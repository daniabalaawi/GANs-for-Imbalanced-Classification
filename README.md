# GANs-for-Imbalanced-Classification
This project focuses on improving classification performance on **imbalanced image datasets**
by generating high-quality synthetic data using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.

A baseline classifier struggled to detect the minority class (digit **9**), despite achieving
high overall accuracy. To address this, GANs were applied as a **data augmentation strategy**.
